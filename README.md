Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of Netflix Movies &amp; TV Shows using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Netflix is one of the most popular OTT platforms globally, offering a wide range of movies, TV shows, and documentaries across various languages and regions. This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's content catalogue to gain insights into its structure and trends.
Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis explores the types of content, countries of origin, release patterns, popular genres, and key creators featured on the platform.

The main goal is to analyse the Netflix dataset to uncover hidden trends, audience preferences, and content evolution over time. These insights can help understand how Netflix curates its content globally.
